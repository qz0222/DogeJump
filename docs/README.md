# DogeJump

[live]

## MVP
Doge Jump is a clone of [doodle jump](http://doodlejump.org/) written in javascript.

Every time the Character lands on a platform, he is projected upward in hopes to
reach a higher platform. The higher the Character goes, the higher the score becomes.
The game is over when the Character stops progressing upward.

- Different platforms for Character to jump on
- Characters with different abilities
- Game over criteria/trigger
- Score
